# FirstAED

# Inspiration
team members have known people who have survived and died from heart attacks and cardiac arrest
family members & friends who have experienced it
when someone dies, you wonder if there's anything you could've done to prevent it
why aren't AEDs as accessible as fire extinguishers? one saves buildings, but the other saves lives
have had first aid training so we are well aware of how crucial time can be when it comes to survival
Marketplace documentary about the lack of accessible AEDs in public spaces & their importance
AEDs are very easy to use and don't require any training at all, unlike CPR
What it does
Problem: When someone experiences cardiac arrest, their chances of survival decrease by up to 10% with every passing minute. After 12 minutes, their chances of survival are less than 5%. With an AED, their chances of surviving are increased by 75%. In order to be effective, they have to be within 100 metres of the scene of a cardiac arrest.

However, many places that do have AEDs don't have them in an accessible location or do not have them registeredPrecious minutes are wasted with hidden/inaccessible AEDs, and if an AED is not registered, the police cannot direct someone to its location. They may waste time getting a AED from somewhere further. When every second counts, this pointless waste could mean life or death.

Moreover, many people are not aware that they should register their AED with Emergency Services. If they are, they don't know how to go about it.

Finally, there is some misinformation and confusion about what heart attacks and cardiac arrests actually are. They are two different things. The symptoms for women are often less known and actually different from those of men. Knowledge is power, and knowing you are experiencing a heart attack or cardiac arrest is the first step to saving yourself.

Goals: To create better access to AEDs in an emergency, educate people about heart attacks and cardiac arrest, and make it easier for people to register their AED.

# What the app does
Finds the location of nearby AEDs, displays them on a map
Spreads awareness about the symptoms of heart attack & cardiac arrest
Better prepares people for crisis situations

# How we built it
using Swift for iOS applications
Mapkit framework
conversion from address to geocode to pinpoint locations
with blood and tears, it was too cold for sweat

# Challenges we ran into
None of us have used Swift previously (didn't understand a lot of syntax, had to constantly Google terms)
difficult to troubleshoot because there was so much we didn't know
We tried Google API at first but because Macs can't read file paths with spaces we had to switch to Mapkit

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
all original images & icons, created on the fly (other than the map)
user-friendly, sleek interface + good branding
building an app with a completely new language (when none of us have ever done iOS development or made an app)
staying determined throughout it all!!

# What we learned
division of labour and teamwork
dived into a new programming language & the world of app development
breaking down a big problem into smaller parts that we can fix
working on a tight deadline
how to ignore the perpetual threat of falling asleep

# What's next for First AED
fine-tune the map display, different colours for the pins so it's clearer where you are and where the AEDs are
locate closest AED and give directions to it, note how accessible it is
link it to a database of AED locations
back-end development for registering your AED
